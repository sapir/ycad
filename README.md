ycad
====

An object-oriented solid CAD programming language

The syntax is inspired by OpenSCAD, Python, Lua, and probably
some other languages, but is intended to be cleaner than OpenSCAD.

For examples of current syntax, see the examples dir:
* [simple.ycad](examples/simple.ycad)
* [pedestal.ycad](examples/pedestal.ycad)

ycad uses [pythonocc](https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc) as a backend.
