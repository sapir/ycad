ycad
====

An object-oriented solid CAD programming language

*This repository is no longer under active development.
Please use [rcad](https://github.com/sapir/rcad) instead.*

The syntax is inspired by OpenSCAD, Python, Lua, and probably
some other languages, but is intended to be cleaner than OpenSCAD.

For examples of current syntax, see the examples dir:
* [simple.ycad](examples/simple.ycad)
* [pedestal.ycad](examples/pedestal.ycad)

ycad uses [OCE](https://github.com/tpaviot/oce) as a backend, with
a Cython wrapper.
